# TRACKER.md

**Purpose: tell a session with zero context where the build actually is —
including what is stubbed, faked, or owed.** Green tests do not mean a
milestone is finished. This file is where that difference is recorded.

Update rules are at the bottom. Updating this file is part of the
Definition of Done for every task.

## Milestone status

Milestones and their "done when" bars come from `SPEC-PLATFORM.md` §18.

| # | Milestone | Status | Done-when bar met? |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Money spine | **Complete** | Yes — invariants fail correctly, postings balance |
| M2 | Domain engine | **Complete** | Yes — a manifest change alters the app with no deploy |
| M3 | Core engagement loop (`document_review`) | Not started | — |
| M4 | Supply: provider onboarding, result-list verifier, per-skill tiers | Not started | — |
| M5 | Sessions | Not started | — |
| M6 | Board | Not started | — |
| M7 | Trust: reviews, disputes, appeals | Not started | — |
| M8 | Seed 15 more domains as data only | Not started | — |
| M9 | Hardening | Not started | — |

**"Complete, with debt"** means the milestone's own bar is met but items in
Open Debt below are outstanding. A milestone is never re-opened; its debt
is carried in the table below until closed.

## Open debt

Ordered by risk. Nothing here is "nice to have" — each is a rule in
`CLAUDE.md` that the code does not yet satisfy, or a lie the code
currently tells.

| # | From | Item | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| D4 | M1 | No payout/refund settle path | `payout_status`/`refund_status` carry `settled`/`failed`, but nothing transitions off `initiated`. No PA webhook handler. Money looks paid in our DB when it has not moved. |
| D5 | M1 | `IdempotencyService` deletes its key on handler failure | A concurrent retry racing that window can double-execute. Acceptable with no live traffic; must close before M6 opens the board to real users. |
| D6 | M2 | Loader cache is per-process | Correct for one deployable. A second instance serves stale manifests until its own publish. Invalidation must become pub/sub before horizontal scaling, not after. |
| D7 | M1 | Reserve balance is unmonitored | `resolvePlatformFailure` draws on `reserve` without limit and the account is expected to run negative. Nothing alerts when it does. Needs a reconciliation check in M9; deliberately not a runtime block, since refusing to make a wronged provider whole is the worse failure. |

**Recently closed:** D1 (money error codes), D2 (per-currency sum-to-zero
test), D3 (reserve-funded platform failure) — all 2026-08-27.

## Stubs and deliberate fakes

Things that exist but are not what they appear to be. **Read this before
trusting any of them.**

| Thing | Reality | Replaced in |
|---|---|---|
| `engagements` table | Minimal stub: `status` is free text, no transition table, and **hard rule #12 (no working state without escrow held AND agenda locked) is not enforced anywhere** | M3 |
| `users` table | Email + role only. No auth, no password, no 2FA (CLAUDE.md #32 unmet) | Identity module |
| Actor identity | Read from an `x-actor-id` **request header**, trusted blindly. Violates CLAUDE.md #28 — must not survive auth landing | Identity module |
| `RazorpayRouteSandbox` / `CashfreeEasySplitSandbox` | Local, no network, always succeed. No declines, no timeouts, no real money | M1 debt / pre-launch |
| `outbox` | Written to correctly and transactionally; **nothing reads it**. No external effect ever fires | `notifications/` relay |
| `MoneyController` (`/internal/escrows/*`) | Ops-only scaffolding so the spine has an HTTP surface. Real holds happen on proposal award | M3 — supersede, don't extend |
| `docs/reference/schema-v4-family.sql` | Reference only; never applied. Assumes tables from schema v1–v3 we never received | n/a |

## Decisions and deviations from spec

Where the build knowingly differs from a spec document, and why. If a
future task is surprised by something, it should be recorded here.

- **Schema is built forward from M1, not from `schema-v4-family.sql`.** The
  supplied schema files (v1–v3) were never provided; only the v4 patch,
  which references tables from them. Confirmed with the user that v4 is
  reference material. Migrations are authored fresh per milestone.
- **`skills` / `assessment_templates` / `credential_types` are a projection.**
  The family `manifest` jsonb is the single source of truth; those tables
  are resynced from it inside the publish transaction so other tables can
  hold real foreign keys. Never hand-edit them.
- **Categories deactivate, never delete, on republish.** A category may
  already be referenced by an engagement by the time a domain is
  republished.
- **Idempotency exists at two layers.** HTTP (`idempotency_keys`, dedupes
  the whole request) and ledger (`ledger_transactions.idempotency_key`,
  last line of defence if a handler somehow runs twice). This is
  deliberate redundancy on money paths, not an accident.
- **No "at least two entries" ledger trigger.** `amount_paise <> 0` plus
  sum-to-zero already makes a single-entry transaction impossible; a second
  trigger for the same case was removed as dead weight.
- **A platform-side failure is its own path, not a refund with a reason.**
  `EscrowService.resolvePlatformFailure` and `POST
  /internal/escrows/:id/platform-failure` are deliberately separate from
  the ordinary refund. CLAUDE.md #23 requires the provider be paid from
  reserve as well as the seeker refunded, and the platform to take no fee;
  making it a flag on `refund()` would let an outage be actioned as a
  plain refund by accident, silently costing the provider their fee. All
  four postings are one balanced transaction, so no crash can pay one
  party and not the other.
- **Money error codes are a published contract.** `money/errors.ts` is the
  registry; nothing in `money/` throws an untyped `Error`. Adding a new
  failure mode means adding a code there and an API test for it.

## Environment notes

- Postgres runs locally in this container and **stops when the container
  idles**. `service postgresql start` before running tests.
- Tests require `DATABASE_URL` to contain `test` (`test/setup.ts` refuses
  otherwise). Current: `postgres://sankalp:sankalp@localhost:5432/sankalp_test`.
- Full suite: `cd apps/api && npm test` — **72 tests, all passing** as of
  this update.
- Docker is unavailable in this environment; use the local cluster.

## How to keep this file updated

Update `TRACKER.md` **in the same commit as the work it describes.** A
tracker updated later is a tracker nobody trusts.

**On finishing a milestone:** set its status. Use *Complete* only if its
`SPEC-PLATFORM.md` §18 done-when bar is genuinely met — otherwise say so
plainly. Add anything you deferred to Open Debt or Stubs; do not let it
live only in a code comment.

**On writing a stub, fake, or hardcoded shortcut:** add a row to Stubs and
Fakes *as you write it*, naming what replaces it. Anything that would make
a future session wrongly believe a thing works belongs here.

**On deviating from a spec document, or making a call the spec was silent
on:** add it to Decisions with the reasoning. Include decisions the user
made in conversation — those are otherwise lost.

**On closing debt:** delete the row. Do not keep a graveyard of struck-out
items; git history holds that.

**Never** mark something complete because its tests pass. Tests prove the
code does what the test says, not that the milestone's bar is met. Check
the bar.

**If this file and the code disagree, the code is right and this file is a
bug** — fix it in the same session you noticed.
